                One of the most straightforward ways to help fight poverty in your community is to donate funds to
                organizations whose mission it is to end these economic disparities. No amount of money is too small or
                too large. <br><br>
                there are ways that don’t require money that can still make an impact. We’ve created a volunteer
                waitlist that you can join to support our work.

                Human beings have certain basic needs. We must have food, water, air, and shelter to survive. If any one

                Before past explorers set off to find new lands and conquer new worlds, they had to make sure that their
                basic needs were met.
